            "content": "Note: Threaded programs allow you to create multiple, parallel paths of execution that all share the same memory space. This is both an advantage and a disadvantage. Any memory shared between threads is subject to one or more threads trying to use the same shared memory at the same time. This can lead to data corruption, data read in an invalid state, and data that’s just messy in general. . In threaded programming, the context switch happens under system control, not the programmer. The system controls when to switch contexts and when to give threads access to shared data, thereby changing the context of how the memory is being used. All of these kinds of problems are manageable in threaded code, but it’s difficult to get right, and hard to debug when it’s wrong. .",

            "content": "Asynchronous Basics . Before we dewel into async basic, lets understand the sync code behaviour. . Sync . It execute one step a time. Even with all conditional branching, loops and function calls. we can still think in terms of code that a single step at a time. when each step is completed, the program moves to next one. . Real Example . Lets think “techie [our bot]” needs to send message to 100 bot friends for special bot get together. Each bot friends reply with different time delay. So on an average each take 30 miliseconds to reply. The “techie [our bot]” as being superfast bot in these bot society with heavy resource hardware and updated software [As we take care of our bot a lot], it replys in 0.5 miliseconds. As this is non-working day, techie decide to send message and wait for other bot to accept/reject invitations, so time taken would be 30.5 milisecods with each bot. this would lead to total time of 30.5 * 100 = 3050 miliseconds (lazy converter, it will take time to convert into seconds). . Now Scenario has been changed as this would be going to very rough day for techie [bcz our team is on trip, everyone is enjoying !!!]. As techie seeing us ignore, decide to have party with bot friends after works. But it seems as of tight Process Schedule”, techie don’t have 3050 miliseconds to send invitation. What to do now !!!. On **thinking techie decided to take approach of async way, secretly our one of team member taught this to techie. Let us see what has been taught to techie secretly. . [confidential notes started !!] . Asynchronous program behave differently, it will take one execution step a time. Asynchronous routines are able to “pause” while waiting on their ultimate result and let other routines run in the meantime. . This means that the program will move on to future execution steps even though a previous step hasn’t yet finished and is still running elsewhere. This also means that the program knows what to do when a previous step does finish running. . Asynchronous programming techniques allow programs to take advantage of relatively slow IO processes by freeing the CPU to do other work. . homework techiniques for techie : polling interval, threading way, context-switching, blocking code &amp; non-blocking code. . [confidential notes ended !!] . we need to first look at techie sync code for bot invitation. . import queue import random import time # create random status behaviour for bots def random_status(bot_info): status = [&#39;online&#39;,&#39;offline&#39;,&#39;busy&#39;] for info in bot_info: info[&#39;status&#39;] = random.choice(status) return bot_info # create random respone delay behaviour for bots def random_response(info): delay = 5 response = random.choice([&#39;accept&#39;,&#39;reject&#39; &#39;on sick leave&#39;]) if info[&#39;status&#39;] == &#39;busy&#39;: delay += random.randint(1,5) time.sleep(delay) return response, delay def imp_message(imp_queue): if imp_queue.empty(): print(&quot;No special attention needed.&quot;) else: while not imp_queue.empty(): info = imp_queue.get() print(&quot;Hi {0},Get well soon !!&quot;.format(info[&#39;name&#39;])) def invite(invite_queue, imp_queue): total_time = 0 if invite_queue.empty(): print(&quot;No new invitation to make.&quot;) else: while not invite_queue.empty(): info = invite_queue.get() print(info) respone, delay = random_response(info) if respone == &#39;on sick leave&#39;: imp_queue.put(info) total_time += delay print(&quot;time taken to get response: {0} millisecond&quot;.format(delay)) print(&quot;time taken in {0} millisecond to complete invitaiton&quot;.format(total_time)) def main(): bot_info = [ {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Smart Bot&quot;}, {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Volter Bot&quot;}, {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Fintech Bot&quot;}, {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Pepper Bot&quot;}, {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;CloudBot&quot;} ] bot_info = random_status(bot_info) invite_queue = queue.Queue() imp_queue = queue.Queue() imp_queue.put({&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Pretbot&quot;}) for info in bot_info: invite_queue.put(info) # sync task for invitation and special message. invite(invite_queue,imp_queue) imp_message(imp_queue) if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: main() .",

Every server contains exactly SAME CODEBASE and DON NOT STORE any user-related data, like session or profile picture, on local disk or memory. . where to store userdata? . userdata needs to be stored in a centralized data store which is accessible to all your app server. . . Database . We can server multiple concurrent request using horizontal scaling Multiple request will lead to lots of read/write request to database which eventually lead to slowness of app. . How to solve data read/write issue? . Path 1 . Do Master Slave Replication (Read from slave, write to master) Upgrade master server by adding more RAM. Sharding | Denormalization | Sql Tunning | . | Path 2 . Switch to NOSql, now joins will need to be done in your app. Sooner your db request will again be slower &amp; slower. you will need to introduce Cache . | . Cache . when to use cache : user have to suffer slow page request when a lot of data is fetched from database. With “Cache” means IN-MEMORY like memcached or redis. . There are two patterns of caching data Cached Database Queries | Cached Object Idea of objects to cache - User Session - Fully Rendered Blog Articles - Activity Streams - User &lt;-&gt; Friend Relationships | Asynchronism . Please wait a while situations . Async #1 . The First way of aysc processing is the pre build the content and serve when request arrive. . This paradigm used to serve dynamic content page of a website are prebuid and locally stored as static website on every change often these computing are done on a regular basis, maybe a scirpt which is called every hour by a cronjob. the static website are stored in cloud object storage. . Async #2 . The Second way of async processing is the system request the heavy computing task, put it in job queue and free the system to do other task and let notify system when it&#39;s done. . User come &amp; start a very heavy computing task such as order product online, so frontend website sends a job onto a job queue &amp; immediately signals back to the user. the job queue is constantly checked by a bunck of workers for new job, the worker do work and signal work done to frontend. . .
